// ### Details Page

// This should show all details **including ALL genres** for the selected movie. You will need to store this data in redux!

//  > Hint : You can make a GET request for a specific movie. Remember `req.params` and `:id`?

// - TODO: The details page should have a `Back to List` button, which should bring the user to the Home/List Page

// > Base functionality does not require the movie details to load correctly after refresh of the browser.
